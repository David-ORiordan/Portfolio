# Dental-Practice-Database

### Description:   
This project consists of a database management system created to cater for a small dentistry business.  
A relational database was created based on the narrative prompt found in the Narrative.pdf file.  
The database's relations satisfy the criteria for being in the first, second, and third normal form.   
The database adheres to Codd's Rules, with the Codd's_Rule.pdf file offering evidence as to how this was demonstrated.  
Through the database, users can view information such as patientsâ€™ details, upcoming appointments, the cost of various procedures, and details of payments made and of outstanding bills.  
An image of the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) can be found in the Relational_Schema.pdf file.  
Further details of the database can be found in the Project_Report.pdf file.  

### How to run:  
Start Apache and MySQL in the XAMPP Control Panel.  
Through your web browser, go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/. Import the dentist.sql file to the database. This will set up a database, consisting of tables, views, and dummy data. 

### Technology used:
- SQL  
- XAMPP Server
